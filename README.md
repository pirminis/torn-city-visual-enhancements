Enhancements:
- Yellow, orange and red item shadows removed but the background is painted instead. Makes it easier to notice the quality of special weapons and armor.
- Weapon and armor bonus icons have increasesed contrast.
- Weapon and armor images have increased contrast.
- Auction page has pagination bar moved up and previous/next buttons glued to the left/right.
- When pressing "Use another" (item) link in the items page, the row does not change height anymore. That means you can spam "Use another" link.
